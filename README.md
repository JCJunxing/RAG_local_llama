# 🧠💡 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Project

Welcome to the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) project! This project leverages powerful language models and advanced document retrieval techniques to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for specific use cases, such as mining documents from the Ontario government. 🚀📄

## Project Overview

Our RAG implementation aims to improve the efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval and generation by combining state-of-the-art LLMs with a robust retrieval mechanism. This ensures that the responses generated by the model are informed by relevant and context-specific documents. 🤖🔍

## Features

- **Advanced LLM Integration**
- **Efficient Document Retrieval**
- **Scalable and Flexible**
